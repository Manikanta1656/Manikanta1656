## 🌟 About Me

I’m a DevOps and Cloud engineer passionate about building clean, automated, and secure infrastructure. My work focuses on using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to reduce manual toil, streamline deployments, and empower teams to ship faster with confidence.

I'm comfortable working across cloud environments — especially **Azure**, while actively expanding into **AWS** and **MLOps/AI-driven automation**.

I enjoy:
- Crafting reusable Terraform modules  
- Architecting CI/CD pipelines  
- Containerizing applications for seamless deployment  
- Exploring MLOps and AI integration into DevOps workflows

## 🔧 Philosophy

🔹 **Automate Everything** — If it can be automated, it should be.  
🔹 **Secure by Default** — Build infrastructure that’s protected before it’s productive.  
🔹 **Readable > Clever** — Clear code and modules that others can extend.  
🔹 **Continuous Learning** — Always curious about new cloud and AI opportunities.
