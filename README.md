## Hi there 👋

# DevOps Engineer, Building Infrastructure That Scales With Your Business, Not Against It

## What I Bring to the Table

I bring principles into DevOps:
- 𝗦𝗮𝗳𝗲𝘁𝘆 → Secure, fault-tolerant infrastructure
- 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 → Finding solutions that no playbook or tutorial covers
- 𝗔𝗱𝗮𝗽𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 → Keeping systems running when theory doesn’t match reality

Proven ability to wear multiple hats while delivering consistent results. From Kubernetes orchestration to technical documentation, I help engineering teams move faster without sacrificing reliability.
